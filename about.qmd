## About Naomi

-   I'm half Japanese and half French, but I was born and raised in Japan until 14 years old.

-   I could be a dog person but I'm more a cat person. I have fostered few cats in the past and I miss them all :(

-   I like studying nature, and be outside for work, however, I'm more of an indoor person during my free time. I love binge watching movies, and sewing some clothes.
